# Docker Exploits
This repository is made to store exploits associated to Docker.  With this exploits, it is possible to abuse capabilities or misconfigurations to breakout containers 



## Capabilities

### DAC_READ_SEARCH

This capability can be used by an attacker to read sensitive files on the host.

You can use the exploit available [here](./Capabilities/DAC_READ_SEARCH/exploit_dac-read-search.c)

To compile it, use the following command 

```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 -O2 exploit_dac-read-search.c -static -o shocker
```

To use it, you need to define a host mounted file on the container with `mount` command. Please find a example below :

Launch the program with the following command :

```bash
./shocker <MOUNTED_FILE> <HOST_FILE_TO_READ>
```

Combined with the capability DAC_OVERRIDE, it is possible to rewrite sensitive files on the host.

You can use the program [here](./Capabilities/DAC_READ_SEARCH/exploit_dac-read-search_dac-override.c). Compile it with the same command as before.

Use it with the following command :

```bash
./shocker_write <MOUNTED_FILE> <HOST_FILE_TO_REPLACE> <LOCAL_FILE_REPLACED_HOST>
```
